// Art Section reader — the five sibling narrative chapters for Les Demoiselles
// d'Avignon, ported VERBATIM from the mockup (art-section.jsx). Reuses the
// drilldown breadcrumb (no toggle in the reader). Each chapter: ChapterHeader
// (eyebrow + h1 + progress bar) · LineageStrip (↑From / ↓To chips) · drop-capped
// house-voice prose with subsection headers + inline figures + pull quotes ·
// a "Meanwhile in…" cross-link sheet · prev/next chapter nav.
//
// Inline figures honour the rights subsystem (audits/art-vertical.md §5,
// samples/art-reader-picasso.html): Demoiselles is pre-1931 / PD-US, so its
// figures render FULL inline with a Rights line. A post-1930 / in-copyright work
// (e.g. Guernica) renders the DEGRADED reference card instead.

          icasso was 25, broke, and living at the top of a tenement on the Montmartre hill called the
          <em> Bateau-Lavoir</em> — the &ldquo;laundry boat,&rdquo; because it creaked when it rained and there was
          one tap on each floor. He was painting in oils on the back of broken doors. He was selling
          two or three canvases a month. He was about to make the painting that would change
          twentieth-century art.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>He was looking at three things he could not stop looking at.</p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="The first thing" title="Cézanne, who had just died" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          Paul Cézanne died in October 1906 in Aix-en-Provence, of pneumonia, after painting in a
          storm. In the months that followed, every painter in Paris went to two memorial shows —
          one at the Salon d&rsquo;Automne, one at Bernheim-Jeune — and tried to understand what
          they had been missing.
        </p>

        <PaintingFigure
          onZoom={onZoom}
          palette={['#5a7042', '#8a7848', '#1c1a12']}

          ratio="6/5"

        />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          What Picasso would later say he saw was an old painter so tired of pretending that perspective
          was real that he had stopped pretending. The bathers were a pyramid. The trees were a pyramid.
          The colours did not blend, they butted. The brushstrokes were visible blocks. You could see
          how the painting had been built.
        </p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="The second thing" title="An Iberian head, in the Louvre" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          In March 1907, his friend the writer Guillaume Apollinaire introduced Picasso to a junior
          employee of the Louvre, who introduced him to a pair of stone heads. They were Iberian —
          stolen, it would later turn out, by the man doing the introducing — small, frontal, with
          almond eyes and a stillness that had nothing in common with the smooth classicism of the
          Greeks one floor up. Picasso bought them for fifty francs each.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          He took them back to the studio. The face he was painting on the leftmost figure of his new
          canvas began to look more and more like those stone heads, every week.
        </p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="The third thing" title="A mask, in the Trocadéro" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          One afternoon in June 1907, Picasso wandered into the ethnographic museum at the Trocadéro
          and, by his own later account, was hit by a feeling he could not name. The hall was full of
          masks — Fang, Kota, Dan, Songye, taken in colonial loot from across French West and Central
          Africa, displayed in vitrines without labels or context, smelling of mildew and disinfectant.
        </p>

        <p style={italicStyle}>I understood, he said, what painting was actually for.</p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The two faces on the right side of the canvas, which had been Iberian three weeks earlier,
          began turning into masks.
        </p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="The canvas" title="Eight feet tall, on the studio wall" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The canvas had been pinned to the wall since the spring. It was 243 × 234 centimetres — nearly
          eight feet square — and Picasso had been making sketches for it since November. There would
          be hundreds of them by the time he was done. The early ones showed a brothel scene with two
          clothed men: a sailor in the middle, a medical student on the left holding a book or a skull.
          By the time it was finished the men were gone. There were only the five women, the curtain,
          the small still life of fruit on the table in front, and the masks.
        </p>

        <p style={proseMutedStyle}>
          He started painting it in earnest in May. By the end of July it was done. Then he showed it
          to his friends.

          icasso made roughly five hundred preparatory sketches for the Demoiselles between November
          1906 and June 1907. He filled at least sixteen sketchbooks. Most of them survive, and reading
          them in order is like watching the painting fight its way out of a more conventional one.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The early drawings show a moralistic brothel scene called <em>The Wages of Sin</em>: five women,
          two men. The man in the middle is a sailor. The man on the left, in the early sketches, is a
          medical student. In some, he holds a textbook; in others, a human skull. The composition is
          theatrical — a curtain pulled back to reveal the women, the men reading the lesson on the
          wages of vice.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          By the late spring the men are gone. The narrative is gone with them. What is left is the
          confrontation: five women, no men, no story, no allegory — a flat group portrait with the
          viewer standing exactly where the two clients used to be.
        </p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="Two campaigns of paint" title="May, and then July" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          He painted the canvas in two waves. The first, in May and early June, was already strange:
          all five faces in the same Iberian-influenced style, big almond eyes and stiff frontal stares,
          like the stone heads from the Louvre. He nearly stopped. He showed the canvas, in this state,
          to almost nobody.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          Then in late June he went to the Trocadéro. When he came back, he attacked the two right-hand
          figures and the left-most one and reworked them as masks. The face of the squatting figure —
          twisted, simultaneously frontal and in profile — is the one nobody can quite forget. It is
          where Cubism, three years later, actually begins.
        </p>

        <p style={italicStyle}>The painting was finished at the end of July 1907.</p>

        <SectionHeader accent={accent} label="What it weighs" title="A few facts about the object" />

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          It is 243.9 × 233.7 centimetres. It is painted in oils on a single piece of linen canvas.
          Its colours are the reds and pinks of flesh, the deep blues of drapery, the rust of earth.
          The picture plane is broken into shards even before Cubism arrives: the curtain on the left
          is a fan of straight cuts; the small still life at the bottom is rendered in three views at
          once. The Iberian face on the left coexists in the same canvas as the African mask on the
          right, as if Picasso wanted you to see, side by side, what painting had been doing — for
          three thousand years before Europe forgot.
        </p>

        <p style={proseMutedStyle}>
          He titled it, privately, <em>Le Bordel philosophique</em> — &ldquo;the philosophical brothel.&rdquo;
          The title it now bears was given by his friend the poet André Salmon, ten years later, for an
          early public showing. The &ldquo;demoiselles&rdquo; in question were five women on the Carrer d&rsquo;Avinyó
          in Barcelona, where Picasso had spent his student years.

          icasso invited his friends to the studio one by one. The unveiling was a small social ritual:
          tea, a single candle, the cloth pulled off the canvas. He was nervous. He wanted them to like
          it. They did not like it.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          <strong>Matisse</strong> was the first big visitor. Matisse was at that moment the most famous
          living painter in France — the Fauve, the man who had scandalised the 1905 Salon with bright
          unmodulated colour, who was thirteen years older than Picasso and his only real rival. He
          looked at the Demoiselles for a long time, and then he said it was an outrage, a betrayal of
          the modern movement, a hoax. He left.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          <strong>Georges Braque</strong>, then 25 and a younger Fauve himself, came to the studio in
          November. He looked at the painting for a long time. According to the dealer Kahnweiler, he
          finally said: &ldquo;Listen, in spite of your explanations, your painting looks as if you wanted to
          make us eat tow and drink turpentine.&rdquo; He left too.
        </p>

        <p style={italicStyle}>A month later Braque was back, painting in something close to Picasso&rsquo;s new manner.</p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          <strong>Gertrude Stein</strong>, Picasso&rsquo;s American patron and friend, was diplomatic; her
          brother Leo Stein laughed. <strong>André Derain</strong> was reported to have said that
          someone would find Picasso hanging from a beam behind the canvas one day. <strong>Sergei
          Shchukin</strong>, the Russian textile baron who was Picasso&rsquo;s main buyer, looked at the
          painting and said it was a great loss to French art.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The one early viewer who is recorded as having seen the picture&rsquo;s importance was Daniel-Henry
          Kahnweiler, a 23-year-old German art dealer freshly arrived in Paris, who had only recently
          opened a small gallery on the rue Vignon. Kahnweiler did not try to buy the Demoiselles
          (Picasso would not have sold it), but he did, from that day, start buying everything else
          Picasso painted.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          To understand why Matisse called it an outrage, it helps to remember that painting in 1907
          had rules. They were not the rules of the Royal Academy; the Impressionists had broken those
          a generation earlier. But there was a tacit modernist code: distort, yes, but for emotional
          effect; flatten, yes, but for compositional grace; quote non-European art, yes, but as
          decoration. What Picasso had done was take all three liberties together, without grace,
          without decoration, and without explanation.
        </p>

        <p style={proseMutedStyle}>
          Picasso took the canvas off the wall, rolled it up, and put it away. It would not be seen
          again in public, except for a brief showing in 1916, for almost a decade.

          icasso rolled up the Demoiselles in late 1907 and propped it against the wall behind some
          other canvases. It stayed there. He moved twice in the years that followed — to a bigger
          studio on the boulevard de Clichy in 1909, and then again, after his marriage to Olga
          Khokhlova, to a respectable flat on the rue La Boétie in 1918 — and the rolled canvas moved
          with him each time.

          Within months of Braque&rsquo;s &ldquo;turpentine&rdquo; visit, Braque had started painting
          landscapes at L&rsquo;Estaque in the south of France that, to Matisse, looked like little
          cubes. Matisse said so to a critic. The critic wrote it down. The label stuck. By 1909
          Picasso and Braque were working in the same studio building in Paris, visiting each other
          daily, deliberately not signing the fronts of their canvases so that buyers had to flip them
          over to find out whose was whose.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          In July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, the poet André Salmon organised a small
          exhibition at the Salon d&rsquo;Antin, on the boulevard d&rsquo;Antin in Paris. Picasso lent
          a single picture. It was the rolled-up canvas from 1907. Salmon, who had to invent a title
          on the spot to print in the catalogue, called it <em>Les Demoiselles d&rsquo;Avignon</em> —
          a softened-up reference to the women on the Carrer d&rsquo;Avinyó in Barcelona. The title
          stuck. It is now what it is called.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The painting was on the wall for one month. The war was on. Paris was distracted. A few
          critics noticed. Most did not. Picasso took the picture down at the end of August, rolled it
          up again, and put it back in the studio.
        </p>

        <p style={italicStyle}>He sold it eight years later, in 1924, to a couturier named Jacques Doucet.</p>

        <p style={proseMutedStyle}>
          Most of the painters who would go on to make Cubism — Léger, Delaunay, Gris, the Italian
          Futurists — never saw the Demoiselles itself. They saw photographs, and they heard about it,
          and they took inspiration from the work Picasso made AFTER it. The picture that broke the
          window had been hiding behind another window the whole time.

          n 1924 the couturier and book collector <strong>Jacques Doucet</strong> bought the Demoiselles
          for 25,000 francs — roughly $1,300 in 1924 dollars, about $20,000 today. The advice he received
          from his friend the poet André Breton was not to buy it because it was beautiful but because
          it was, Breton said, the door through which a new century was going to walk.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          Doucet hung the painting at the foot of the marble staircase in his Paris apartment. Visitors
          complained, in their later memoirs, about having to climb the stairs past it. Doucet&rsquo;s widow
          consigned it for sale in 1937. It went unsold in Paris and was shipped to New York.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          In 1939 the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> acquired the Demoiselles in a complicated
          three-way trade. The museum gave up a Degas — <em>Race Course at Longchamp</em> — and roughly
          $24,000 in cash, drawn from the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. The total value of the trade in 1939
          dollars was about $28,000. Today that is approximately $620,000.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          The painting has hung at MoMA, with a few short-lived rearrangements and one loan, ever since.

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          By the 1950s the Demoiselles had become, in the textbooks, the canvas where modern painting
          actually began. By the 1980s the more interesting question had become whether anything could
          have happened in twentieth-century painting WITHOUT it. By the 2000s a generation of scholars
          had begun to point out — quite correctly — that the act of importing the formal language of
          African masks without acknowledging their makers had aesthetic and ethical costs we are still
          working through.
        </p>

        <p style={proseStyle}>
          All of which is true. And the painting hangs at MoMA, and a new generation of young painters
          stand in front of it every year and try to understand what it is. They cannot, exactly. That,
          one might argue, is what makes it the painting that it is.

          Picasso himself painted for another sixty years. His most famous later canvas &mdash;{' '}

          the kind of work this app often can&rsquo;t hand you in full. Painted after 1930, it is still under
          copyright in the United States, not only abroad. So here it is the way the rights regime leaves it:
